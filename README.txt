QuanQonscious: GRVQ-TTGCR Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulation Framework
=======================================================================

Overview:
---------
QuanQonscious is a production-grade library integrating General Relativity,
Vedic Mathematics, and Quantum Computing into a unified framework—the GRVQ-TTGCR.
It provides:
  • A complete 29-sutra Vedic library (with 16 main sutras and 13 sub-sutras)
    implemented as a dedicated dependency module.
  • An advanced GRVQ Ansatz construction using 4th-order radial suppression and
    adaptive constant modulation.
  • A Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) solver with GRVQ corrections.
  • TTGCR hardware driver simulation (frequency setting, sensor feedback, entropy
    monitoring) without kill-switch routines.
  • An HPC 4D PDE solver with MPI-based block-cyclic memory management and GPU
    acceleration (using JAX for CUDA-A100).
  • A Bioelectric DNA Encoder module employing fractal Hilbert curve transformation.
  • Extended quantum circuit simulation using Cirq.
  • Automated performance profiling, dynamic dependency updating, and integrated
    bottleneck evaluation routines.
  • A custom Vedic quantum cipher (Maya key cryptography) for cryptographically secure
    watermarking of mathematical proofs and algorithmic outputs.

Installation:
-------------
This package requires Python 3.10+, along with the following dependencies:
  - numpy, scipy, jax, jaxlib
  - mpi4py
  - cirq
  - hashlib (standard library)
  - Other standard packages

To install the required dependencies, run:
    pip install numpy scipy jax jaxlib mpi4py cirq

For GPU acceleration, ensure you have a CUDA-A100 environment available.

Usage:
------
Import the main module in your application:
    from grvq_ttgcr import (VedicSutraLibrary, GRVQAnsatz, FCISolver, TTGCRDriver,
                             hpc_quantum_simulation, BioelectricDNAEncoder,
                             extended_quantum_simulation_cirq, orchestrate_simulation,
                             run_full_benchmark, FutureExtensions)
                             
Then use the provided classes and functions to build your simulation workflow.
