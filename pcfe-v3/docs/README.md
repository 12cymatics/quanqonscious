# Proto-Consciousness Field Engine (PCFE) v3.0

PCFE is a hybrid quantum-classical engine designed to explore emergent
consciousness phenomena through advanced field simulations. The project
supports GPU acceleration via CUDA and distributed computation using MPI.

## Features
- GRVQ, TGCR and MSTVQ field dynamics
- 29 Vedic sutra implementations
- MPI-based distributed computation
- CUDA accelerated kernels
- Comprehensive validation suite

See the `examples/` directory for quick start guides and usage examples.
